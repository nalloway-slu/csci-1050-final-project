Final Project for CSCI 1050-01: Intro to Computer Science - Multimedia

## Brief Reflection
In this project, I built a system for writing virtual novels using p5.js, and then I wrote such
a novel. To do so, I've recontextualized some photographs I've taken previously by combining them
with some sketches done on a drawing tablet. I've come to quite like this sort of artstyle, although
I think some work could be done in improving the visual clarity/contrast of the sketches
against the photograph backgrounds.

The biggest thing I learned while doing this project is that I ought to set harder, smaller limits
on what I want to do with my project in order to avoid overscope. In particular, I have come to learn
that while developing a system with abstraction may pay off for long term projects, sometimes having a
concrete, simple solution pays off more in the short term.
