Opening scenes go here...

Natalia
Hey.

Nathaniel
Oh, hey. Didn’t see you come over.

Natalia
Some say I can just appear like that.

Nathaniel
I see.

NARRATOR

NARRATOR

NARRATOR

Natalia
So what was it you wanted to talk about?


> Oh, no reason...

Nathaniel
Oh, no reason... Just figured, I dunno...

Nathaniel
...

Nathaniel
Sometimes, it’s just good to talk, y’know?

Natalia
Yeah, I hear ya.

NARRATOR
...

NARRATOR
...

Natalia
So have finals been going well for you?


> Just checking on how you’re doing...

Nathaniel
Just checking on how you’re doing. I know it’s been a while since we’ve talked.

Natalia
Ah, gotcha. We’ll I’m doing fine as usual. You?

Nathaniel
Pretty well, I guess. Bit worried about finals, but who isn’t?



Natalia
Of course.


Natalia
How have they been going, anyway?


> Things have been getting weird between us.

Nathaniel
Things have been getting weird between us.

Natalia
Oh? What do you mean?

Nathaniel
Like, I dunno. We haven’t talked much in a while. I’m just worried that something’s happening, that maybe you’ll think I’ve been avoiding you.

Natalia
Ah, I see.

NARRATOR
...

Natalia
I haven't felt like you've been avoiding me. I mean, from my end, I think it's just that we've all been getting kinda busy, especially with finals, right?

Nathaniel
Right, yeah.

NARRATOR
...

NARRATOR
...

Natalia
How have finals gone for you, anyway?


REJOIN <

Nathaniel
Oh well, they've gone mostly as good as I could hope for.

Natalia
Knowing you, that’s probably pretty good.

Nathaniel
I think so, yeah, although... Been feeling kinda iffy with my Poli-Sci final.

Natalia
How so?

Nathaniel
Well actually it was more of an essay—

Natalia
—Oh, rough—

Nathaniel
—But it is what it is. Got something out the door.

Natalia
You haven’t talked to me much about your political science class, actually. Have you been liking it?

Nathaniel
It’s been fine, it’s just...

Nathaniel
Could never really get myself into it.

Nathaniel
That’s not to say that I didn’t enjoy the class. Had a great professor, nice guy. And I found the material important.

Nathaniel
It was just... Hard to wrap my head around? I couldn't get a lot of it, and I think a lot of that's because I don't really have much experience talking about international politics, but...

Nathaniel
Y'know, what matters is that I grappled with the material anyway, since it was important.

Natalia
Right.

Nathaniel
My philosophy final, though... I think that went a lot smoother?

Natalia
You have an easier time with philosophy than political science?

Nathaniel
Kinda, yeah, I guess? I mean, in some cases I think philosophy was harder to understand than Poli-Sci.

Nathaniel
But, I enjoyed it. Was interesting hearing about all these weird and wacky concepts. And so many fourfolds...

Natalia
Fourfolds?

Nathaniel
Yeah, like uh...


> With Guattari

Nathaniel
... with Guattari’s functors for subjectivity.

Nathaniel
You've got like, four different functors, each mapping out a different part of how one's identity can start to change.

Nathaniel
You've got F, for flows of desire.

Nathaniel
Then Phi, for “phyla,” or sets of knowledge.



Nathaniel
And then U, for universes of value. So think like, I dunno, integrity or patience.

Natalia
I know patience is something we both wish we had.

Nathaniel
Agreed.

Nathaniel
But yeah, lastly we have T for existential territories. That’s the places and behaviors that you constantly inhabit and experience.

Nathaniel
So when a person has certain desires flow through them, they can use the knowledge they have...

Nathaniel
...and the values they’ve come to develop...

Nathaniel
...to change what sorts of “rhythms” they inhabit, what kinds of habits they have and behaviors they do. So they shift their territories.

Natalia
Sounds complicated.

Nathaniel
Yeah, and I think that was only the dumbed-down version our professor gave us, not the full thing.


> With Heidegger

Nathaniel
...with Heidegger’s “dwelling” fourfold.

Nathaniel
You’ve got like, four different elements when it comes to the human experience.

Nathaniel
There’s the earth, the material nature we inhabit and coexist with.

Nathaniel
Then there’s the sky above everything, with the weather and the day and night.

Nathaniel
Then there’s the immortals: the sacred, or as my professor would likely put it, the “ever-living forces“ that shape the earth.

Nathaniel
And lastly you’ve got us, the mortals, who live together in companionship, who live together constantly confronted with their death.

Natalia
That last one sounds a bit morbid.

Nathaniel
Well yeah, but we *will* all die, yeah? And in being confronted with our death, we continue to find the drive to keep living life while we can.

Natalia
Hm...

Nathaniel
At least, I think that’s how that works.


REJOIN <

Nathaniel
I don't really get it that well, to be honest.

Natalia
I mean, I don’t think most people get philosophy, either.

Nathaniel
Yeah, but I think that stuff’s kinda important.

Natalia
Well, it’s like what you said with Poli-Sci earlier... You “grappled with it“ ’cus you found it important, and now you continue to “grapple with“ this stuff as you keep on learning.

Nathaniel
Right, yeah...

NARRATOR
...

NARRATOR
...

Nathaniel
There’s a bunch of other stuff that I don’t really understand.

Natalia
Yeah, like what?


> Like you.

Nathaniel
Like you, I guess.

Natalia
Oh?

If `weird` was the option picked at the start...

Natalia
This doesn’t have to do with, like, “things being weird“ as you mentioned earlier, right?

Nathaniel
No, I don’t think... At least I don’t think so.

Natalia
...

Nathaniel
Well, it’s mostly me being weird, I suppose.

Natalia
Oh.

Either way, continue with...

Nathaniel
It’s just, I dunno...

Nathaniel
I always think you’re so cool.

Natalia (staring)
...

Nathaniel
You’re like an enigma to me. You always seem so effortless in what you do.

Natalia
...

Nathaniel
And I know it’s really unfair of me to say that. I *know* you put in so much effort to be able to do the things you do, be who you are...

Natalia
I do put a lot of effort into this.

Nathaniel
Yeah... But me knowing something is not the same thing as me *feeling* something, *perceiving* something.

Nathaniel
...

Nathaniel
I just wish I could be as cool as you are.

Natalia
I think you’re cool.

Nathaniel
...

Natalia
You do a lotta weird maths. I don’t know how you do that—

Nathaniel
—Sometimes I don’t even know myself—

Natalia
—But yeah, exactly. You do something, it appears easy, but we both know it isn’t.

Nathaniel
Mm.

NARRATOR
...

NARRATOR
...

Nathaniel
There’s also me, I guess.

Nathaniel
I mean, yeah, I *can* do a lot of maths, and I think of myself as a mathematician...

Nathaniel
But sometimes I think to myself that maybe it’d be better if I switched?

Natalia
Switch majors, you mean?

Nathaniel
Yeah. Like, do philosophy instead. Or at least do more of it. I dunno.

Nathaniel
It’s like, at one point I think I know my interests, but at another I’m no longer sure.

Natalia
Hm...


> Like myself.

Nathaniel
Like myself, I guess.

Natalia
What do you mean?

Nathaniel
I mean, I thought I was gonna be a mathematician when I grew up.

Nathaniel
Well no, at first I thought I was gonna be an engineer. But then I decided on maths in high school.

Nathaniel
But now I’m thinking... With all this philosophy stuff, maybe it’d be better if I switched?

Natalia
Switch majors, you mean?

Nathaniel
Yeah. Or at least, do more philosophy and stuff. I dunno.

Nathaniel
At one point I think I know my interests, at another I’m no longer sure.

Natalia
Hm...

NARRATOR
...

NARRATOR
...

Nathaniel
And then there’s you.

Natalia
What about me?

Nathaniel
I mean, sometimes you just seem like an enigma to me. You just seem so cool. Everything you do looks so effortless.

Natalia (staring)
...

Nathaniel
And I know it’s really unfair of me to say that. I *know* you put in so much effort to be able to do the things you do, be who you are...

Natalia
I do put a lot of effort into this.

Nathaniel
Yeah... But me knowing something is not the same thing as me *feeling* something, *perceiving* something.

Natalia
All this personal talk...

Natalia
You’re always one to over-intellectualize these sorts of things, I think.

Nathaniel
I can see that.

Natalia
But like, it’s the same sort of principle you were talking about before, right?

Natalia
You don’t know something, so you “grapple with” it, you wrestle with it. ’Cus it’s important.

Nathaniel
Right, yeah.

Natalia
Just the same way with your studies, you gotta grapple with understanding yourself.

Natalia
And maybe there’s a bit more discomfort here since you’re trying to understand a topic that’s much more personal.

Nathaniel
Mm...

Natalia
But you gotta sit with that discomfort. It takes effort. But I know you can do it.

NARRATOR
...

NARRATOR
...

If Guattari was chosen earlier...

Natalia
It’s like with what you said about Guattari. You gotta expand those “phyla” or whatever. You gotta explore your values.

Natalia
Then you can shift your territories. Become someone else, bit by bit.

Natalia
Try being closer to the person you want to be. Then you’ll realize you were always “cool” all along.

Nathaniel
...

If instead Heidegger was chosen...

Natalia
It’s like with what you said about Heidegger. We’re all mortals. We all gotta face our death.

Natalia
So we may as well face our life as well. If there’s something you want to discover or change about yourself, you gotta try it out now while you can.

Natalia
And you’ve got other mortals too that you can share your experiences with.

Nathaniel
...

Just the same, rejoin here.

Nathaniel
Yeah, maybe you’re right.

Nathaniel
...

Nathaniel
No, no, you’re definitely right. I oughtta start doing something. Start exploring.

Natalia
Yeah. All it takes is some practice.

Natalia (arm cupping cheek)
And a bit of self-kindness.

NARRATOR
...

NARRATOR

NARRATOR
...

Nathaniel
It’s been good talking with you.

Natalia
Mm.

Nathaniel
I appreciate how much you’ve been helping me.

Natalia
I’ll always be here to do that.

Nathaniel
It’s just, I’m sorry I’ve mostly been talking about my own concerns. I know you’ve probably got your own worries to deal with.

Natalia
No, no, it’s fine...

Natalia
...

Natalia
Well, in way, we both got to talk about our own worries.

Natalia
We are the same person, after all.

Nathaniel
Right...
