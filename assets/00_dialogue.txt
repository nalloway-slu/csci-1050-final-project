say Just checking on how you’re doing. I know it’s been a while since we’ve talked.

speaker Natalia
say Ah, gotcha. We’ll I’m doing fine as usual. You?

img awkward_4

say Like, I dunno. We haven’t talked much in a while. I’m just worried that something’s happening, that maybe you’ll think I’ve been avoiding you.

speaker Natalia
say Ah, I see.

say ...

say I haven’t felt like you’ve been avoiding me. I mean, from my end, I think it’s just that we’ve all been getting kinda busy, especially with finals, right?

img finals_1
speaker Nathaniel
say Oh well, they’ve gone mostly as good as I could hope for.

speaker Natalia
say Knowing you, that’s probably pretty good.

speaker Nathaniel
say I think so, yeah, although... Been feeling kinda iffy with my Poli-Sci final.

speaker Natalia
say How so?

img finals_2
speaker Nathaniel
say Well actually it was more of an essay—

speaker Natalia
say —Oh, rough—

speaker Nathaniel
say —But it is what it is. Got something out the door.

speaker Natalia
say You haven’t talked to me much about your political science class, actually. Have you been liking it?

img finals_3
speaker Nathaniel
say It’s been fine, it’s just...

say Could never really get myself into it.

say That’s not to say that I didn’t enjoy the class. Had a great professor, nice guy. And I found the material important.

say It was just... Hard to wrap my head around? I couldn't get a lot of it, and I think a lot of that's because I don't really have much experience talking about international politics, but...

img finals_2
say Y'know, what matters is that I grappled with the material anyway, since it was important.

speaker Natalia
say Right.

img fourfold_0
speaker Nathaniel
say My philosophy final, though... I think that went a lot smoother?

img fourfold_1
speaker Natalia
say You have an easier time with philosophy than political science?

img fourfold_2
speaker Nathaniel
say Kinda, yeah, I guess? I mean, in some cases I think philosophy was harder to understand than Poli-Sci.

img fourfold_3
say But, I enjoyed it. Was interesting hearing about all these weird and wacky concepts. And so many fourfolds...

img fourfold_4
speaker Natalia
say Fourfolds?

img fourfold_5
speaker Nathaniel
say Yeah, like uh...

options bp_fourfold f_fourfold
pause


# If option 2...
if f_fourfold 2 goto 280

# Else...


# Option 1: With Guattari
say ... with Guattari’s subjectivity fourfold.

img fourfold_6
say You've got like, four different functors, each mapping out a different part of how one's identity can start to change.

say You've got F, for flows of desire.

say Then Phi, for “phyla,” or sets of knowledge.

say And then U, for universes of value. So think like, I dunno, integrity or patience.

img fourfold_7
speaker Natalia
say I know patience is something we both wish we had more of.

speaker Nathaniel
say Agreed.

img fourfold_6
say But yeah, lastly we have T for existential territories. That’s the places and behaviors that you constantly inhabit and experience.

say So when a person has certain desires flow through them, they can use the knowledge they have...

say ...and the values they’ve come to develop...

say ...to change what sorts of “rhythms” they inhabit, what kinds of habits they have and behaviors they do. So they shift their territories.

img fourfold_8
speaker Natalia
say Sounds complicated.

speaker Nathaniel
say Yeah, and I think that was only the dumbed-down version our professor gave us, not the full thing.
goto 320
# End of option 1




# Option 2: With Heidegger
say ...with Heidegger’s “dwelling” fourfold.

img fourfold_6
You’ve got like, four different elements when it comes to the human experience.

say There’s the earth, the material nature we inhabit and coexist with.

say Then there’s the sky above everything, with the weather and the day and night.

say Then there’s the immortals: the sacred, or as my professor would likely put it, the “ever-living forces“ that shape the earth.

say And lastly you’ve got us, the mortals, who live together in companionship, who live together constantly confronted with their death.

img fourfold_7
speaker Natalia
say That last one sounds a bit morbid.

speaker Nathaniel
say True! But we *will* all die, yeah? And in being confronted with our death, we continue to find the drive to keep living life while we can.

img fourfold_8
speaker Natalia
say Hm...

speaker Nathaniel
say At least, I think that’s how that works.

say I don't really get it that well, to be honest.

speaker Natalia
say I mean, I don’t think most people get philosophy, either.

speaker Nathaniel
say Yeah, but I think that stuff’s kinda important.

img fourfold_9
speaker Natalia
say Well, it’s like what you said with Poli-Sci earlier... You “grappled with it“ because you found it important, and now you continue to “grapple with“ this stuff as you keep on learning.

# Resuming option 1...
img cooler_6
speaker Nathaniel
say It’s just, I dunno...

img cooler_5
say I always think you’re so cool.

speaker Natalia
say ...

speaker Nathaniel
say You’re like an enigma to me. You always seem so effortless in what you do.

speaker Natalia
say ...

img cooler_6
speaker Nathaniel
say And I know it’s really unfair of me to say that. I *know* you put in so much effort to be able to do the things you do, be who you are...

img cooler_8
speaker Natalia
say I do put a lot of effort into this.

img cooler_5
speaker Nathaniel
say Yeah... But me knowing something is not the same thing as me *feeling* something, *perceiving* something.

img cooler_3

say I just wish I could be as cool as you are.

img cooler_7
speaker Natalia

img cooler_6
speaker Nathaniel
say There’s also me, I guess.

say I mean, yeah, I *can* do a lot of maths, and I think of myself as a mathematician...

img cooler_5
say But sometimes I think to myself that maybe it’d be better if I switched?

img cooler_7
speaker Natalia
say Switch majors, you mean?

img cooler_5
speaker Nathaniel
say Yeah. Like, do philosophy instead. Or at least do more of it. I dunno.

say It’s like, at one point I think I know my interests, but at another I’m no longer sure.

speaker Natalia
say What do you mean?

img cooler_5
speaker Nathaniel
say I mean, I thought I was gonna be a mathematician when I grew up.

img cooler_6
say Well no, at first I thought I was gonna be an engineer. But then I decided on maths in high school.

img cooler_5
say But now I’m thinking... With all this philosophy stuff, maybe it’d be better if I switched?

img cooler_7
speaker Natalia
say Switch majors, you mean?

img cooler_5
speaker Nathaniel
say Yeah. Or at least, do more philosophy and stuff. I dunno.

say At one point I think I know my interests, at another I’m no longer sure.

speaker Natalia
say You’re always one to over-intellectualize these sorts of things, I think.

img cooler_8
speaker Nathaniel
say I can see that.

img cooler_7
speaker Natalia
say But like, it’s the same sort of principle you were talking about before, right?

speaker Natalia
say You don’t know something, so you “grapple with” it, you wrestle with it. ’Cus it’s important.

speaker Nathaniel
say Right, yeah.

img cooler_9
speaker Natalia
say Just the same way with your studies, you gotta grapple with understanding yourself.

say And maybe there’s a bit more discomfort here since you’re trying to understand a topic that’s much more personal.

speaker Nathaniel
say Mm...

say But you gotta sit with that discomfort. It takes effort. But I know you can do it.
